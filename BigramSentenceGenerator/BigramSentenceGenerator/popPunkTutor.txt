It's time to kick the habit, I'm coming clean
It's been a hell of a ride but it's all caught up with me
And now I'm off track
Feel like I'm right back where I started
Sat on the kitchen floor all alone talking to a ghost
About where we go when we go
He said, "Life is the great unknown"
Better jump, better run and…
Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
'Cause you're on your way
Oh my friend, just look how far you've come
And think twice before you go and throw it all away
Between the peace and panic
I can't break up the static
I need a cleaner frequency
I frequently burn out and vanish
I'm on another planet
There's just no getting through to me
But then I find myself in bed
Lost inside my head again
Running over everything
The voices, they are deafening
Out from the noise
I hear that familiar voice
He says "Life is the great unknown"
Better jump, better run, better go
Better jump, run
Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
'Cause you're on your way
Oh my friend, just look how far you've come
And think twice before you go and throw it all away
'Cause you're on your way
You're on your way
'Cause you're on your way
'Cause you're on your way
Don't stop now
Though the motion sickness has you spinning out
'Cause you're on your way
Oh my friend, just look how far you've come
And think twice before you go and throw it all away
Before you throw it all away
Before you throw it all away
Oh what a time to be alive
Wake up and smell the dynamite
And keep your eyes locked tight to that screen
And don't believe everything that you see
You will find modern life's a catastrophe
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls, dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
Oh, we almost had it
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames
When the world went up in flames
We all worship celebrities, desperate for an identity
But cigarettes and MDMA don't give you substance
You don't think about what you say
'Cause your mouth is bigger than your brain
It's a shame, so fake and you’re all the same
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls, dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
Oh, we almost had it
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames
When the world went up in flames
There's a Black Cat in the windows of Parliament
There's a man in the back of a black cab, talking about the good days
When it all went up in flames
Happy Judgement Day
It all went up in flames
Happy Judgement Day
Is it just me or does anyone else feel like this could be farewell?
Oh, we almost had it then we pissed it all away
Building walls and dropping bombs
Stop the world, I'm getting off
It's been a long time coming
Never thought I'd see the day
It's been a long time coming
Never thought I'd see the day
When the world went up in flames
The world went up in flames
I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Anyone else but me
This straightjacket chokes me and digs in
This tightrope is swaying in the wind
And it's a long way down
No way out of this alive
Oh it's a long way down
When the tension gives out
'Cause that's when I snap
And that's how I'm feeling now
Oh my head, tripped and fell too hard again
Lost myself, lost myself in the nervous wreck
I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Anyone else but me
This dissonance blurs the lines
And fucks with my symmetry
I'm one twisted butterfly
Will never be quite good enough
And I'm holding on so I don't come undone
But I feel like giving up
Oh my head, tripped and fell too hard again
Lost myself, lost myself in the nervous wreck
I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Anyone else but me
All eyes on me
But that's not reality
'Cause my mind plays tricks on me
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
Crawling up the walls
Caving as they are caving in
Claustrophobic in my own skin
From holding it all in
Oh my head, tripped and fell too hard again
Lost myself, lost myself in the nervous wreck
I'm coming to the conclusion
I think I would rather be
Woah I, I think I'd rather be
Anyone else but me
Anyone else but me
It's another day
Wanna get away from here
There's a plane out on a runway
Gonna run away from here
'Cause the rain is so terribly dull
And it bores me
Yeah misery adores me
I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe that we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?
I'm done with small town politics
I need to make my way to where the action is
I'm done with it, so the question is
Are you coming with?
'Cause baby, if you like, I'll take you there
Imagine all the places we could go to disappear
Or we could turn the light off and go back to bed
Stare at the stars on your ceiling and pretend that we're somewhere else
I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe that we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?
We don't need a God to take a leap of faith
Listen when I say that if we don't try 
That if we don't try
Then we won't believe 
Then we won't believe
I wanna break out and get away
I wanna just try and live for me
'Cause if we don't try then we won't believe
That we could have had it
I wanna let go, and fall for you
And when it gets rough, be your parachute
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
'Cause I'm ready
I wanna do the things that you only read about
Are you ready?
Almost fourty-eight hours have passed since the fall of an atomic bomb, and an attack upon the cities of man
And even now we are only beginning to see the aftermath of a massive display of destruction and power that has uprooted our fresh outset of peace in civilised society
Despite the rubble there is a predominant sense of wonder and marvel at the awesome nature of this technological terminus that has bewildered the very core of the human psyche
Sometimes at night, I let it get to me
And sometimes, I'm sure it gets to all of us
And last night it had me down, I'm feeling numb
I can try, but sometimes that is not enough
No, sometimes that is not enough
No, sometimes that is not enough
And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom
And thinking back upon those days
Way way back when I was young
I was such a little shit
'Cause I was always on the run
Well you know just what they say
Just like father then like son
Don't delude me with your sympathy
'Cause I can do this on my own
And this won't be the last time
That I break down and wanna crawl to bed
'Cause the truth is
You're the only voice I wanna hear in my head so
Stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom
All in bloom
And stop calling me out, we're never going to
Put the pieces back together
If you won't let me get better
And stop digging it up or we're never gonna
See it all in bloom
All in bloom
All in bloom
Disrupt and keep dividing
The government is lying
I'm not going to be a Pharisee of this society
Turn off your TV station
That's not real information
Trying to define the human mind
It's like puppetry
And they've got you by your strings
Playing God for money
A sorry sad charade
You can see right through it
Don't wait for anyone
Say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference?
Would you open your eyes?
Whoa oh, whoa oh
Suspend your disbelief
Are you paying close attention?
If you blink then you might miss their tricks and their deception
Distrust and disobey the lies they say
Cause all the world's a stage
And if you choose to read the news
Then you must question everything
And they've got you on your knees
They've got your milk and honey
And then we put them on the parade
And celebrate what's coming
Don't wait for anyone
Say it for you
Say it for yourself
What if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference?
Would you open your eyes?
Whoa oh, whoa oh
No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Dig deep, believe
The truth will set you free
No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Dig deep and see
The government is lying
Don't wait, don't wait for anyone, for anyone
Say it for you
Say it for yourself
Yeah what if God was the beggar in disguise?
Would it make any difference?
Would you open your eyes?
No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Dig deep, believe
The truth will set you free
No kings
No queens
No justice
No peace
Would it make any difference?
Would you open your eyes?
You have sixteen new messages
First new message:
Why do I even bother calling you
I’ve called you sixteen times today
And I know you’ve been online
So stop ignoring me
I made a critical mistake in a momentary lapse of judgement
Now you've called me up again to remind me of the ways I've fucked up
So then I'll just take all the blame
It all just feels the same
And we move on
Then I screw it up again
Are you noticing a trend
Should I go on?
So I said
I could be everything you need
If you could learn to be someone else
I keep trying to bridge the distance
You've been thinking about yourself
It's the way you want the world to be
It's the way you want the world to be
I'm the sinner you're the saint
You will always have your way
Will you let go?
But when a cynic and a snake come together
It could take a miracle
But it only lasts so long
I know it won't be long 'till I screw up
Could we start it all again
And go back to when we're both wrong
'Cause we're both wrong
So I said
I could be everything you need
If you could learn to be someone else
I keep trying to bridge the distance
You've been thinking about yourself
It's the way you want the world to be
It's the way you want the world to be
And it always seemed too perfect to be true
There's nothing perfect about me and you
And I tried to see the best
But I saw right through you
And I know I could be better
But you won't let me forget
That it always seemed so perfect when I played it in my head
You made a critical mistake in a momentary lapse of judgement
Now I'm walking out that door
Like all the times before
Guess I fucked up
So I said
I could be everything you need
If you could learn to be someone else
I keep trying to bridge the distance
You've been thinking about yourself
It's the way you want the world to be
It's the way you want the world to be
I could be everything you need
If you could learn to be someone else
Take it slow
Tell me all how you've grown just for me
Could we all reminisce
Better yet, here's a pen
Make a list
Fill it full with all the things I've missed
'Cause I can barely drive past the school
Without stopping to think of you
And how we used to act a fool
But worst of all I wish I called
At least a thousand times or more
Just to hear what I've been missing
If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times that we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here
Thinking back on the days
Where we all used to say
I know anywhere's better than here
In the back of the class
Where we grew up too fast
Living life like there's nothing to fear
But the eyes on the road
Driving home all alone
Singing along to a song from three summers ago
The one that made you remember it
Now I'll always remember it
As the song that your life ended with
If a picture is all that I have
I can picture the times we won't get back
If I picture it now it don't seem so bad
Either way, I still wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
Either way, I still wish you were here
And they say you're in a better place
But a better place is right here with me
Yeah they say you're in a better place
Too bad it's not what I believe
'Cause a picture is all that I have
To remind me that you're never coming back
If I picture it now it just makes me sad
And right now I just wish you were here
Don't say everything's meant to be
'Cause you know it's not what I believe
Can't help but think that it should've been me
In the end, I just wish you were here
Yeah they say you're in a better place
Either way I still wish you were here
They say you're in a better place
In the end I just wish you were here
What goes through your head
Yeah my thoughts never stop
I'm hanging by a thread
It's too late she said
And no I don't believe
Things are always as they seem
You proved this to me
Forget the theory
I've heard some heavy lies
So say you're true
And take off your disguise
'Cause I want you
And here it goes again
We're softly spoken
My skin and your fingertips
Your lonely lips start to twist
We're talking of our deepest fears
It's like we don't exist
We don't exist to the world outside
Baby there's a world inside your room tonight
And it's yours and mine
The sun goes down
But we stay up all night
I've heard some heavy lies
So say you're true
And take off your disguise
'Cause I want you
There's a world outside
Baby there's a world inside your room tonight
And it's yours and mine
The sun goes down
But we stay up all night
And I just can't ignore
Several weeks of back and forth
And I've not said this before
But I'm saying it now
You're better off with me
And I've heard some heavy lies
So say you're true
And take off your disguise
'Cause I want you
'Cause I want you
And I've heard some heavy lies
So say you're true
And I've heard some heavy lies
Like I love you
Let's start it here
Back in nineteen-seventy-sumthin'
I can't pin down the year
When the romance wasn't dead
And love still stood for something
There was a girl who had lost her way
She blushed red when he came over
And they danced the night away
And he sung as he drove her home and
It was there that she would say
If I could than I would save you
And he smiled and turned away
In six weeks they're saying "I do"
Oh, love just don't go that way no more
And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And we just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all
And now it's nineteen-ninety-sumthin'
How the hell did we end up here?
Four kids and a few jobs later
And the pictures fill the pages
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But you'd be a fool to give it up
'Cause you know that what we've got is bigger than the two of us
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But it's bigger than the two of us
And I will hold you in my arms
When you feel like giving up
Love just don't go that way no more
And like the seed becomes the tree;
We take shape of a family
We grow and we change
And face the rain like you wouldn't believe
And through it all
We're standing tall
And we just don't say it enough
If not for you, no we wouldn't be standing at all
And now its two-thousand-and-sumthin'
We made it here my dear
Grandkids and the mortgage paid off
Is this what dreams are made of?
'Cause baby we made it
Yeah baby you saved me
But nothing could save him
From the ambulance that day
When he went away
The heart attack was sharp
He didn't feel no pain
If you saw him now then what
What would you say?
I love you and I miss you
I owe you everything
And I hope you know you saved me 
saved me!
Oh mother
Mother please don't cry
'Cause you know I miss him too
I didn't even say goodbye
And though he's gone, I know he's gone
He lives on in all of us
And I will hold you when you cry
'Cause that's what he would have done
Yeah, that's what he would have done
Yeah, that's what he would have done
It's been hard, oh it's been hard
But he's a part of all of us
And we will hold you when you cry
'Cause that's what family does
Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I guess I'll never know
If when we're gone there's a place to go
Or if we don't see anything at all
Is that what we're supposed to call faith?
Well if that is that, and it all just fades to black
And we don't see anything at all
We don't see anything
What are you waiting for?
Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
The world is a funny place
It kicks you when you're down
And knocks you out when you get up again
I don't think it's worth suffering through
But on the other hand
There's a world full of possibilities
And a million other people just like you
Who've all been through what you've been through
They were singing...
Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't put my faith in a fallacy
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I saw it all flash and pass by with bright lights
And right before my eyes was the exit sign
I saw it all flash and pass by
And asked why I wasted precious time
It just passed me by
It just passed me by
We are just passing by
Just passing by
Just passing by
Oh we are just passing by 
Just passing by
Just passing by
Pain, pain go away, come back another day
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I don't wanna wait for a goodbye to see what could've been
I just wanna get one up on life before it kills me
I can't go back
It's not how it was before
It's the calm after the storm
It's the mess left after war
I'm a mess but I'm dying for more
Take me back
We can't go anywhere
I'll give you all that I have
You are simply standing there
You pulled me in and said
Just slow down
Say something sweet
Something sweet and innocent
Sing me to sleep
'Cause baby I missed it
I hope you believe it
'Cause I mean it
Without you, the world was a drag
Without you, life had no meaning
I've come too far
Too far to go back now
Too high to come back down
Too lost for a way out
And we can never escape
There's no hope
There's no hope for you and me
There never will be
We're fucked
Oh this is love
Just slow down
Take a minute
Stop yourself
And listen
Say something sweet
Something sweet and innocent
Sing me to sleep
'Cause baby I missed it
I hope you believe it
'Cause I mean it
Without you, the world was a drag
Without you, life had no meaning
Oh this is beautiful madness
We swing between love and sadness
Oh this is beautiful madness
The hurricane won't sweep me up today
So let's go dance in the damage
Say something
Something sweet and innocent
Sing me something
'Cause baby I missed it
I hope you believe it
'Cause I mean it
Without you, the world was a drag
Yeah without you, the world was a drag
Without you, life had no meaning
Without you, life had no meaning
Can you feel it
In the spaces all around and in between it
Did you mean it
When you said I hate you
'Cause I fucking believed it
If you can't see the signs
And I can't reach your mind
I'd be scared of what I might find
And I'm sorry
I'll take the blame but you came at me kamikaze
A tsunami is setting our way
So is your apology
We really should have thought it through
Just what this would do to me and you
So ask yourself is it worth it
Yeah take it from me
Nobody is perfect
'Cause all I want to do is fall asleep with you
To drift away and hold onto
Is it worth it
Tell me is it
Worth it?
Is it pointless
To be helpless, optimistic, non-conformist
Am I annoying?
I try as hard as I could but you couldn't ignore it
'Cause I'm so sick and tired
Of these late night and getting wired
On our fucked insecurities
We really should have thought it through
Just what this would do to me and you
So ask yourself is it worth it
Yeah take it from me
Nobody is perfect
'Cause all I want to do is fall asleep with you
To drift away and hold onto
Is it worth it
Tell me is it
Worth it?
Can you feel it?
In the spaces all around and in between it
Did you mean it?
'Cause I fucking believed it
Think it through
And what this could do to me and you
Yeah ask yourself is it worth it
To pour the gasoline if it's already burning
'Cause all I want to do is fall asleep with you
To drift away and hold onto
Is it worth it
Tell me is it
Worth it?
Ask yourself is it worth it?
'Cause all I want to do is fall asleep with you
Is it worth it?
